## Welcome to My GitHub Profile!
Hey there, fellow developers! Welcome to my GitHub profile. It looks a bit empty in here, huh? Well, I'm trying to fix that. I am excited to say that I just finished college, so now I will be coding full time, and this place should be bumping in just a few months.

### About Me
I'm a passionate programmer with a deep love for education and intelligence gathering. I know those two things don't have much in common, but I love the idea of designing software that can teach people as much as it can protect them. Nowadays, I primarily focus on front-end development, but I do want to work on embedded systems someday.

### My Projects
I have worked on some things through college, but many of them had to be archived because of old and rudimentary coding. Now that I know more, I will be taking a swing at some of them again with bigger brain muscles!

#### Current Project - Simpl1f1ed.com: 
This is a web app using React JS. This is my dev website where I will be posting tutorials for front-end development.
#### Astralis Academy (*Archived Unfinished*): 
This was my first attempt at an educational website that used a design allowing users to work through a tree of requirements, clearly seeing a path to success.
#### UserSearch (*Archived Unfinished*): 
This was my first attempt at an intelligence gathering website. I was able to gather information on Xbox users using the Microsoft REST API and Azure API interface. I wanted to be able to type one name in and get results from all gaming and social networks. I have not given up on this one yet and really want to continue working on it.
#### Capstone Project (*Archived*): 
This project was my first real attempt at a functioning web app. It was the final project for my degree program and was completed in around 4-5 weeks. I am happy I did this because now I know not to use Flask for anything more than a quick school project. I now use React.
### Get in Touch
I'm always eager to connect with other developers who are interested in similar things as me. If you would like to connect, send me a message using one of the methods below:
